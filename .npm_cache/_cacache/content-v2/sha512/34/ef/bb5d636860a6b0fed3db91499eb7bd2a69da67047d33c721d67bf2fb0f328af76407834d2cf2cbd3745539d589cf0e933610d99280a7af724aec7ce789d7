It is designed for JavaScript runtimes like Node.js, Browsers, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, and more.\n\n## Features\n\nThe following features are currently in scope and implemented in this software:\n\n- Authorization Server Metadata discovery\n- Authorization Code Flow (profiled under OpenID Connect 1.0, OAuth 2.0, OAuth 2.1, FAPI 1.0 Advanced, and FAPI 2.0)\n- Refresh Token, Device Authorization, Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA), and Client Credentials Grants\n- Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP)\n- Token Introspection and Revocation\n- Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR)\n- UserInfo and Protected Resource Requests\n- Authorization Server Issuer Identification\n- JWT Secured Introspection, Response Mode (JARM), Authorization Request (JAR), and UserInfo\n- Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)\n- [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/) Strategy\n\n## Sponsor\n\n<picture>\n  <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panva/openid-client/HEAD/sponsor/Auth0byOkta_dark.png\">\n  <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panva/openid-client/HEAD/sponsor/Auth0byOkta_light.png\">\n  <img height=\"65\" align=\"left\" alt=\"Auth0 by Okta\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panva/openid-client/HEAD/sponsor/Auth0byOkta_light.png\">\n</picture>\n\nIf you want to quickly add authentication to JavaScript apps, feel free to check out Auth0's JavaScript SDK and free plan.

If you find the module useful, please consider supporting the project by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/panva).\n\n## [API Reference Documentation](docs/README.md)\n\n`openid-client` is distributed via [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openid-client), [jsr.io](https://jsr.io/@panva/openid-client), and [github.com](https://github.com/panva/openid-client).\n\n## [Examples](examples/README.md)\n\n**`example`** ESM import[^cjs]\n\n```ts\nimport * as client from 'openid-client'\n```\n\n- Authorization Code Flow (OAuth 2.0) - [source](examples/oauth.ts)\n- Authorization Code Flow (OpenID Connect) - [source](examples/oidc.ts) | [diff](examples/oidc.diff)\n- Extensions\n  - DPoP - [source](examples/dpop.ts) | [diff](examples/dpop.diff)\n  - JWT Secured Authorization Request (JAR) - [source](examples/jar.ts) | [diff](examples/jar.diff)\n  - JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode (JARM) - [source](examples/jarm.ts) | [diff](examples/jarm.diff)\n  - Pushed Authorization Request (PAR) - [source](examples/par.ts) | [diff](examples/par.diff)\n- Passport Strategy - [source](examples/passport.ts)\n\n## Quick start\n\n```ts\nlet server!: URL // Authorization Server's Issuer Identifier\nlet clientId!: string // Client identifier at the Authorization Server\nlet clientSecret!: string // Client Secret\n\nlet config: client.Configuration = await client.discovery(\n  server,\n  clientId,\n  clientSecret,\n)\n```\n\n### Authorization Code Flow\n\nAuthorization Code flow is for obtaining Access Tokens (and optionally Refresh Tokens) to use with\nthird party APIs.\n\nWhen you want to have your end-users authorize or authenticate you need to send them to the authorization server's `authorization_endpoint`. Consult the web framework of your choice on how to redirect but here's how\nto get the authorization endpoint's URL with parameters already encoded in the query to redirect\nto.\n\n```ts\n/**\n * Value used in the authorization request as the redirect_uri parameter, this\n * is typically pre-registered at the Authorization Server.\n */\nlet redirect_uri!: string\nlet scope!: string // Scope of the access request\n/**\n * PKCE: The following MUST be generated for every redirect to the\n * authorization_endpoint. You must store the code_verifier and state in the\n * end-user session such that it can be recovered as the user gets redirected\n * from the authorization server back to your application.\n */\nlet code_verifier: string = client.randomPKCECodeVerifier()\nlet code_challenge: string =\n  await client.calculatePKCECodeChallenge(code_verifier)\nlet state!: string\n\nlet parameters: Record<string, string> = {\n  redirect_uri,\n  scope,\n  code_challenge,\n  code_challenge_method: 'S256',\n}\n\nif (!config.serverMetadata().supportsPKCE()) {\n  /**\n   * We cannot be sure the server supports PKCE so we're going to use state too.\n   * Use of PKCE is backwards compatible even if the AS doesn't support it which\n   * is why we're using it regardless. Like PKCE, random state must be generated\n   * for every redirect to the authorization_endpoint.\n   */\n  state = client.randomState()\n  parameters.state = state\n}\n\nlet redirectTo: URL = client.buildAuthorizationUrl(config, parameters)\n\n// now redirect the user to redirectTo.href\nconsole.log('redirecting to', redirectTo.href)\n```\n\nWhen end-users are redirected back to the `redirect_uri` your application consumes the callback and\npasses in PKCE `code_verifier` to include it in the authorization code grant token exchange.\n\n```ts\nlet getCurrentUrl!: (...args: any) => URL\n\nlet tokens: client.TokenEndpointResponse = await client.authorizationCodeGrant(\n  config,\n  getCurrentUrl(),\n  {\n    pkceCodeVerifier: code_verifier,\n    expectedState: state,\n  },\n)\n\nconsole.log('Token Endpoint Response', tokens)\n```\n\nYou can then fetch a protected resource response\n\n```ts\nlet protectedResourceResponse: Response = await client.fetchProtectedResource(\n  config,\n  tokens.access_token,\n  new URL('https://rs.example.com/api'),\n  'GET',\n)\n\nconsole.log(\n  'Protected Resource Response',\n  await protectedResourceResponse.json(),\n)\n```\n\n### Device Authorization Grant (Device Flow)\n\n```ts\nlet scope!: string // Scope of the access request\n\nlet response = await client.initiateDeviceAuthorization(config, { scope })\n\nconsole.log('User Code:', response.user_code)\nconsole.log('Verification URI:', response.verification_uri)\nconsole.log('Verification URI (complete):', response.verification_uri_complete)\n```\n\nYou will display the instructions to the end-user and have them directed at `verification_uri` or\n`verification_uri_complete`, afterwards you can start polling for the Device Access Token Response.\n\n```ts\nlet tokens: client.TokenEndpointResponse =\n  await client.pollDeviceAuthorizationGrant(config, response)\n\nconsole.log('Token Endpoint Response', tokens)\n```\n\nThis will poll in a regular interval and only resolve with tokens once the end-user authenticates.\n\n### Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA)\n\n```ts\nlet scope!: string // Scope of the access request\n/**\n * One of login_hint, id_token_hint, or login_hint_token parameters must be\n * provided in CIBA\n */\nlet login_hint!: string\n\nlet response = await client.initiateBackchannelAuthentication(config, {\n  scope,\n  login_hint,\n})\n\n/**\n * OPTIONAL: If your client is configured with Ping Mode you'd invoke the\n * following after getting the CIBA Ping Callback (its implementation is\n * framework specific and therefore out of scope for openid-client)\n */\n\nlet tokens: client.TokenEndpointResponse =\n  await client.pollBackchannelAuthenticationGrant(config, response)\n\nconsole.log('Token Endpoint Response', tokens)\n```\n\nThis will poll in a regular interval and only resolve with tokens once the end-user authenticates.\n\n### Client Credentials Grant\n\nClient Credentials flow is for obtaining Access Tokens to use with third party APIs on behalf of your application, rather than an end-user which was the case in previous examples.\n\n```ts\nlet scope!: string // Scope of the access request\nlet resource!: string // Resource Indicator of the Resource Server the access token is for\n\nlet tokens: client.TokenEndpointResponse = await lib.clientCredentialsGrant(\n  config,\n  { scope, resource },\n)\n\nconsole.log('Token Endpoint Response', tokens)\n```\n\n## Supported Runtimes\n\nThe supported JavaScript runtimes include those that support the utilized Web API globals and standard built-in objects. These are _(but are not limited to)_:\n\n- Browsers\n- Bun\n- Cloudflare Workers\n- Deno\n- Electron\n- Node.js[^nodejs]\n\n## Supported Versions\n\n| Version
